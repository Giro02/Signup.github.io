      <p>This project aims to investigate the functionality of login and registration forms:<br><br>
      1. On the registration page, the username and password are stored in the LocalStorage if they do not already exist.<br><br>
      2. On the login page, if the user exists, a script generates and stores a random token with a timestamp for that user. If the user or password is invalid, an error message is displayed, and the input fields are highlighted in red.<br><br>
      3. On the current page you are reading, two checks are performed. Firstly, it is verified whether you accessed the page using the login form; otherwise, you will be redirected back to the login page. 
      Secondly, a timer is set to expire the created token after 1 minute. Once this 1-minute period elapses, all data is removed from LocalStorage, and you will need to register again.</p>
